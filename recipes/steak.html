        <h3>Cooking the perfect steak at home is easier than you think, 
            all thats needed is the right prep and a little know-how.
        </h3>
        <h3>What you need</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> A 2 inch thick ribeye, strip or chuck steak</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Cast iron skillet</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How its done</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First things first, you need to prep your steak. Before cooking, let the steak rest
                at room temperature for an hour. This will help the steak cook more evenly when it hits the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Salt the steak. At the beginning of the rest period, liberally salt 
                the meat with kosher salt. As the steak sits, the salt will draw moisture from 
                the meat and over an hour the moisture will be reabsorbed, drawing salt into the steak.
                This results in both a juicer steak and a better sear.</li>
                <li>Cook the steak. In a lightly oiled, searing hot cast-iron skillet cook the steak for 
                    two minutes on each side for rare, 4 for medium. 
                </li>
        </ol>
